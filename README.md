# A First Look: Speed Effects on ISO (Code and Visuals)

## Description
This project is an attempt to find the effect that a hitter's sprint speed has on his statistic [Isolated Power (ISO)](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/isolated-power). This repository includes notebooks containing cleaning and exploratory analysis of imported Statcast from the pybaseball package, application of unsupervised machine learning techniques, light feature engineering, and the use of several different supervised machine learning classification methods to perform multi-class classification on a highly imbalanced dataset of singles, doubles, and triples. Some of these methods include probability calibrated Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classifiers, a probabilistic Tensorflow neural network, and Weighted or Balanced Random Forest Classifiers. All models were evaluated on several classification metrics, including precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and the recall of each individual class. The methods for cleaning data, plotting visualizations for model performance, or implementing model towards individual predictions are included in the 'Scripts' folder.
All exploratory analyses of data are located in the 'Analysis Notebooks' section, and the use of supervised machine learning classifiers to preprocess data and train/test models are in all folders containing models. A greater in-depth explanation of the code can be found at my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@joshsalce).

### Motivation
Much of this project's inspiration has been inspired by Corbin Carroll, outfielder for the Arizona Diamondbacks. His ability to stretch hits that for nearly everyone else are singles into doubles, and from doubles to triples, caused me to wonder how his sprint speed could affect his ISO based on how often he could take an extra base at times where other hitters may not be able to.
